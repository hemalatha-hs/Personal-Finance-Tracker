# Personal-Finance-Tracker

The "Personal Finance Tracker" is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users manage their financial transactions by tracking income and expenses. Users can input the date of each transaction, ensuring it follows the "dd-mm-yyyy" format. Additionally, users can use the default date, which is the current date, if they choose not to input one. The application prompts users to enter the transaction amount, ensuring it is a positive, non-zero value, and requests the transaction category, which can be either 'Income' or 'Expense'. Users can also add an optional description for each transaction to provide more context. This straightforward tool helps users keep a detailed and organized record of their financial activities.
